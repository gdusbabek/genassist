# Playlist generator website

## Plans

### First iteration

1. You enter in the name of the song
2. Conduct a search, let the user show his preference
3. Have a few controls to steer the playlist:
    * Date preference
    * Number of items
4. Generate
5. Save

### Later

Playback. This will be easy for Rdio.
Crawler that searches for songs. Turn those into a playlist.

## Dependencies

The echonost dependency has been hacked to add support to the newer dynamic playlist API.
