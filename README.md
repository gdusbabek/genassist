# Playlist generator website

## Plans

### First iteration

1. You enter in the name of the song
2. Conduct a search, let the user show his preference
    * select a song, then generate a popup asking:
        * number of songs
        * date preference
3. Generate
    * regenerate
5. Save

Skinning the UI will take some work.  Resist the urge to do this first. Get things working, then futz with the UI.

### Later

Playback. This will be easy for Rdio.
Crawler that searches for songs. Turn those into a playlist.

## Dependencies

The echonost dependency has been hacked to add support to the newer dynamic playlist API.
